## Idea-1
Computing a new, secure password generator based on the parameters: length, character set and other things
Regressing an empirical specification n times with new controls added in every regression run
Scrape a news website every day to generate a summary with timely updates

## Idea-2
Ideation, Collaboration and Consolidation
Discuss expectations from the tool at the start of the project
Use standardized notations and naming conventions

## Idea-3
To write a tool which has misleading CLI options
Tool that does not raise warning messages 
Tools that depend on the very machine's specific configurations and would not work if shared
